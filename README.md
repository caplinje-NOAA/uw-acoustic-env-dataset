    The underwater acoustic environment DS is meant to be a complete set of inputs
    for any propagation model. The envDS incorporates bathymetry, sound speed profiles,
    seabed parameters, and source data into one xarray dataset.  Data is checked to ensure
    consistent naming conventions and reporting of metadata see exampleUsage.py for examples.
    Currently, only bathymetry is range dependent.
